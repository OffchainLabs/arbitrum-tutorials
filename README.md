# Arbitrum Tutorials

This monorepo will help you get started with building on Arbitrum chains. It provides various simple demos showing and explaining how to interact with Arbitrum chains (including Orbit chains) — deploying and using contracts directly on Arbitrum, moving Ether and tokens between the parent and child chains, and more.

We show how you can use broadly supported Ethereum ecosystem tooling (Hardhat, Ethers.js, etc.) as well as our special [Arbitrum SDK](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk) for convenience.

## Installation

From the root directory:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Testing

1. Start the nitro-testnode (you can find instructions [here](https://docs.arbitrum.io/run-arbitrum-node/run-local-full-chain-simulation)) with the following parameters:

```shell
./test-node.bash --init --tokenbridge --l3node --l3-token-bridge
```

2. Execute all tests with the following command

```shell
yarn run testAll
```

## How to run the tutorials against a custom network

As mentioned above, these tutorials use the [Arbitrum SDK](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-sdk), which loads the regular Arbitrum chains by default (Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova and Arbitrum Sepolia). You can use these tutorials against any other Arbitrum chain (including Orbit chains), by loading it to the Arbitrum SDK.

To do that, fill in the information of your chain in the [`customNetwork.json`](./customNetwork.json) file, which is automatically loaded in all tutorials.

To obtain the information of a specific chain, you can use the method [`prepareArbitrumNetwork`](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/arbitrum-orbit-sdk/blob/main/src/utils/registerNewNetwork.ts#L18) of the Orbit SDK.

You can also register multiple chains if you need to (for example, for the `l1-l3-teleport` tutorial). In that case, create an array of chain information objects in the `customNetwork.json` file.
